class Condition:
    """Represents the current state of a watchdog condition.

    An Entry has a single condition that is triggered or not.  Whenever its
    state changes to triggered, the watchdog device will act (add condition to
    warn list, call notifiers, execute action).  When the state changes to not
    triggered, it will remove the condition from the warn list and execute the
    ok action, if configured.

    The complex logic regarding preconditions and grace time is handled by
    stacking Condition objects on top of each other.

    Besides triggered, the condition can also be "expired": if some cache keys
    used to calculate the triggered state are not available anymore, the
    condition becomes expired and the user is notified.

    Finally, conditions can be disabled, which means that their triggered
    state is ignored.  They can be disabled by the user directly, or by
    configuring them to be specific to certain setups.
