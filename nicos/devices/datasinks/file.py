(e.g. ``%(proposal)s_%(pointcounter)08d``) with the following keys:

* counters:

  - ``(type)counter`` for globally unique counters
  - ``(type)propcounter`` for unique counters within a proposal
  - ``(type)samplecounter`` for unique counters within a sample directory \
    (for many instruments, there is no separate sample directory, so this \
    counter is the same as the propcounter)
  - ``(type)number`` for the dataset's number within its parent

  ``type`` is the dataset type, e.g. ``point`` or ``scan``.

* proposal info from the experiment (e.g. ``proposal`` for the prop. number)

* all devices and parameters (e.g. ``dev1`` for the value of dev1 and
  ``dev1.param`` for a parameter)
