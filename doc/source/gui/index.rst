GUI configuration and development
=================================

The NICOS GUI is a graphical application using the Qt framework and `PyQt
<http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt>`_.  It is highly
configurable and can be adapted to UI standards and instrument needs.  Custom
widgets and panels can be implemented (using Qt base classes and techniques)
with a few APIs provided by the NICOS base library.
