    Input:

    # first frame and the master chopper, controlling all the possible phases
    # from 240 deg (the initial opening) up to 360 (when the master chopper
    # closes). For each phase, the path of the neutron is followed, checking
    # if it crosses a closed disk during the flight. The disks 1 and 2 are
    # assumed to have a single aperture of 120 deg. disks 3 and 4 are assumed
    # to have multiple apertures, as they have. In particular disk3 has four
    # apertures. If the edge of the beam closing is null, the apertures are
    # located:
    #
    # - between 213.0 deg and 217.0 deg
    # - between 223.5 deg and 226.5 deg

    # disk4 has also four apertures. If the edge of the beam opening is
    # null, the apertures are located:
    #
    # - between   0.0 deg and 120.0 deg (main aperture)
    # - between 153.0 deg and 157.0 deg
    # - between 164.0 deg and 166.0 deg
