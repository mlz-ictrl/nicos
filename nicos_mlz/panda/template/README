# Instrument specific template files for PANDA
#
# Hint: all files ending in .template will be templated upon NewExperiment
# or NewSample and then stored without that suffix into the scriptdirectory
# (not overwriting exisitng files). Other files are 'just copied over',
# overwriting older copies.
#
# Templating works by replacing constructs like {{key:default_value#description}}
# with the value of <key> as given in the proposal or as keyword argument to NewExperiment/NewSample,
# if no key is found, the (optional) default value is used.
# if both are missing, NICOS complains and gives key and description to aid
# specifying the right arguments.
#
# please list all files after the following line with a short description.
# contents:
start_{{proposal}}.py.template  # startupfile, put all relevant things here
{{proposal}}.py.template        # example script for users
blenden.py                      # slitscans, speeds up setup of experiment
FRMdatdata.m                    # Datafile loading routine for matlab
PandaLoad.py                    # Datafile loading routine for python
mailtext.txt                    # mailbody used at panda
