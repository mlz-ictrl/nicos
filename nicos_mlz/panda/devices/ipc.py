IPC Motor cards made by Göttingen have (at least) two major problems:
a) triple cards reset all three channels upon a reset command.
b) sometimes they drive the stepper motor with wrong stepping frequencies,
   basically not moving it.

a) poses a problem for NICOS, because issuing a reset command to one channel
should not influence other channels. As we don't know which devices (if any)
are connected to the other two channels, we try to store the parameters
(which include the current position) into the internal eeprom before issuing
a reset. This is a real problem, if not all channels are used for encoded axes!

It is still unclear if the reset is needed at all, or what it really does.

b) is difficult, as NICOS assumes that if Hardware (motordriver) says it moved
by a certain number of steps, the corresponding motor actually did just that.
If it doesn't, and the axis has an encoder, NICOS raises an internal Exception
(Schleppfehler) or if the requested movement was small, a PositionError and
then retries the positioning after calling a reset on the motor.
Here a) and b) play together to make instrument scientists very unhappy.

As far as we could figure out, once b) happens, the card appears to be 'locked'
in that state, where it 'forgets' to use the accel-ramp for a movement and
instead just ramps down, starting from twice the normal stepping frequency.
No stepper motor can handle that, so no actual movement happens.
So NICOS again gets an Exception, calls reset and retries until it finally
gives up after maxtries tries.

So far we found one reliably working sequence to go out of this 'locked state'
by issuing a reset and then moving to a slightly different position.
If one of those two steps is missing, it does NOT _reliably_ free the card from
that state. (i.e. sometimes it still works.)

The chance to enter that 'lock'state seems to depend on a combination of
the accel, speed, microstep, position and target value.
We suspect an internal overflow. Unfortunately, once that state is entered,
changing only the target position does not seem to allow it to exit that state.

We try to work around this by following the sequence of:
- change current position a little bit
  (This should avoid entering the 'locked' state again, but still maintain
  (roughly) the same position. THIS IS NOT IDEAL! (anybody have a better idea?)
- save all params to eeprom, so that the other channels of this card are not
  reset to bogus values.
- do a reset (which actually resets all channels!)

    U N T E S T E D !

Firmware-upgrade of the cards is impossible, as the developer is no longer
available and we don't have access to the sourcecode...
