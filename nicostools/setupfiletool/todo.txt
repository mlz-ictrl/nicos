- When switching the instrument from one to another, ask whether to save the
  edited setups.

- When adding a custom parameter, allow selection of the type (e.g. display
  some common used python classes such as str, int, float or list).

- Make sysconfig widget more user friendly. E.g. allow editing of existing
  values, allow replacing already entered values, etc.

- Handle special cases (attached devices).
