    This commands does not actually start the tomography

    "tomo_abort()" or finished with "tomo_resume()" before another

    same parameters are performed, there is no need to use
    the "tomo_setup()" command several times, only set up once
    and then use "tomo_run()" for each of the tomographies.

    >>> tomo_setup(sp2_ry, 625)

    Setting up a 375 projections tomography at measurement position 3,
    with 3 images per projection:
