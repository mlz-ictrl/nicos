"""
  At SINQ, we use batch files in the form of spreadsheet tables in csv format.
  The workflow is such that the instrument scientist prepares the header,
  the user fills in their data and then executes the spreadsheet. For editing,
  a normal spreadsheet program is used and the table then exported in csv
  format.

  The header row of the table has a special meaning: it defines how the
  following table lines are expressed through the column names. Supported are:
  - device names, this causes the device to be driven to the value given in
    later table rows
  - NICOS parameter names. This causes the corresponding NICOS parameter
    to be set
  - timer or monitor are special names which cause a count() command to
    be called with either a timer or monitor preset
  - command is another special name which causes the command specified
    as data to be executed verbatim.

  Device driving and parameter setting commands are executed first, then
  monitor, timer or command. Of these three only one can be present in
  any given row.

  The way this is implemented is that the csv file is cross compiled to a NICOS
  python file which then is executed through the normal script running commands
  of NICOS.
