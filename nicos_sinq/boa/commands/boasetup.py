"""
This implements BOA configuration discovery. BOA has a very variable
instrument configuration. The system works like this:
1) Through an external script, the EPICS IOC is restarted
2) During startup, the EPICS IOC discovers the available hardware and
   sets a number of EPICS database fields informing about the presence
   of hardware.
3) This code reads those flags and compares them with the NICOS configuration.
   And then unloads and loads setups as required.
4) Where this is possible, the BOA tables are also reconfigured
5) At the end a messages is produced which tells the user about those bits
   which cannot be auto configured.

This whole stuff is very specific to BOA and tightly coupled with the IOC
configuration and startup.
