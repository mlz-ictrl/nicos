    At CAMEA we have this large tank with multiple analysers banks
    each containing in themselves multiple analysers. One of them
    will be selected to provide the counts for counting. Correspondingly
    at CAMEA a4 is the value of the physical motor plus the offset in a4 to
    the selected analyser. This offset comes from a calibration file. We cannot
    use the standard offset for two reasons:
    - The application of the offset needs to be compatible with SICS
    - This a4offset is fixed and comes from the calibration file. We need
    the actual motor offset in order to account for the skewness of the
    instrument and the sample.
