    The high Q detector in the SANS-LLB tank could potentially crash
    into a rail. This class is supposed to prevent this. It allows z only to be
    moved when x is beyond a certain threshold. X can only be moved beyond the
    threshold when z is lower than a threshold value. The latter case serves
    the parking position use case for the detector.
